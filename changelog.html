        </strong>

        <li>0.4.1</li>
            - Add a feature to allow expanding vote counts even when you don't have the required 1000 reputation points. It's enabled by default. Thanks to Rob W (who <a href="https://stackapps.com/questions/3082/view-vote-totals-without-1000-rep" target="_blank">wrote the original script</a>) and thedemons (who <a href="https://github.com/AnthoPakPak/StackOverflowPowerUser/pull/6" target="_blank">added the feature in this extension</a>) for making this possible.<br/>
            - Fix "Show indicator when there isn't any answer to the question" feature, accidentally broke in previous update
        <br/><br/>
        <li>0.4.0</li>
            - Update extension to use the new Manifest v3, made mandatory by Google, to prevent the extension from breaking in a few months<br/>
            - Sidebar: remove number of favorites information from the popover, since this information isn't available anymore
        <br/><br/>
        <li>0.3.5</li>
            - Update answer percent score styling, to match more with SO theme (<a href="https://github.com/AnthoPakPak/StackOverflowPowerUser/issues/2" target="_blank">as requested here</a>)<br/>
            - Sidebar: fix information popover not showing up anymore with SO website changes<br/>
            - Remove "Hide the useless StackOverflow left sidebar" feature since it can now be done natively from SO user preferences (<a href="https://github.com/AnthoPakPak/StackOverflowPowerUser/issues/3" target="_blank">see here</a>)
        <br/><br/>
        <li>0.3.4</li>
            - Fix sidebar answer count which was broken due to StackExchange DOM update<br/>
            - Increase min duration between two auto expand votes, because it seems SO has increased it to ~2sec
        <br/><br/>
        <li>0.3.3</li>
        - Fix broken extension due to favorites now being bookmarks<br/>
        - Change a bit sidebar color to fit better with the new SO dark mode
        <br/><br/>
        <li>0.3.2</li>
        - Fix extension which was (again) broken due to StackExchange DOM update<br/>
        - Change URL matching wildcard to allow running on subdomains like ru.stackoverflow.com
        <br/><br/>
        <li>0.3.1</li>
        - Fix extension which was broken due to StackExchange DOM update
        <br/><br/>
        <li>0.3.0 (This update is pretty huge!)</li>
        - The code has been totally refactored, improved, documented in preparation to open sourcing. You can now
        contribute on the extension by making PR on <a href="https://github.com/AnthoPakPak/StackOverflowPowerUser" target="_blank">GitHub</a>.
        You can also submit bugs reports or feature requests there ;)<br/>
        - Add a feature to automatically expand all comments (hidden behind "show X more comments") when you use
        CMD/Ctrl + F to search in page. This way you ensure that you are searching the whole page and are not
        missing any results.<br/>
        - Add a feature to hide "Hot Network Questions" & "Meta Posts" blocks from SO right sidebar to prevent
        distraction (as requested by @Mikey Stengel)<br/>
        - Settings page : sort features by categories to improve readability + settings are now saved automatically
        when you change an option (no need to click the Save button anymore)<br/>
        - Improve the "Auto expand votes count" feature to avoid reaching SO limit while navigating through answers
        with arrow keys
        <br/><br/>
        <li>0.2.2</li>
        - Add a feature to bring scrolling behavior to vote buttons, so that you still see them even on long posts. This
        feature is enabled by default and can be disabled in settings (but I'm pretty sure you will love it!).<br/>
        - Answers Sidebar : add the question vote number in the popup implemented in 0.2.0<br/>
        - Fix the "upvote question from Answer Sidebar" feature implemented in 0.2.1 that was broken (sorry about that)
        <br/><br/>
        <li>0.2.1</li>
        - Answers Sidebar : add the ability to upvote question right from the answers sidebar, so that you don't have to
        scroll to the top to do it (as suggested by @Géza Kiss)<br/>
        - Answers Sidebar : add an indicator to know if question is upvoted (as suggested by @Géza Kiss)<br/>
        - Create a separate Changelog page that will appear every time the extension is updated
        <br/><br/>
        <li>0.2.0</li>
        - Fix extension for StackOverflow website update<br/>
        - Answers Sidebar : add the ability to hover the number of answers cell to get additional information about the
        current page<br/>
        - Small bug fixes in Answer Sidebar
        <br/><br/>
        <li>0.1.4</li>
        - Add new Stack Exchange websites support
        <br/><br/>
        <li>0.1.3</li>
        - Automatically disable <em>Auto expand votes count & Show answer score</em> if you doesn't have enough
        reputation (the setting is not disabled in this settings page, to prevent you from being unable to use it when
        you'll have enough rep)
        <br/><br/>
        <li>0.1.2</li>
        - Add option to disable the new left sidebar that appears on every page (it will only disable it on
        questions/answers pages, and not in profile etc)
        <br/><br/>
        <li>0.1.1</li>
        - Improve settings page
        <br/><br/>
        <li>0.1.0</li>
